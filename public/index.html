                                    as a career, and wanted to find a new and exciting one. After much thought, I decided

                                    next and learning how to best utilize them.

                    <p>This was my final group project at Origin Code Academy. We inherited the project from a previous group, and worked on improving the current features and adding additional ones. I worked on solving several errors that ranged from styling issues to faulty functions, and also implementing the profile component. If any of teammates were having issues, I would do what I could to help them.<br />The biggest but also most enjoyable challenge for me on this project was learning and understanding React Native. There were several situations where we thought we knew how to accomplish certain goals because of our previous experience, only to find out that React Native does it a very different way. Several of the styling errors I corrected stemmed from the differences between our previous experience and React Native. For example, the CSS properties were in Camel Case instead of hyphenated. We were able to solve our issues by going over documentation, and even creating our own apps.</p><br /><p>Technologies used: React Native, Redux, Axios, MongoDB, Loopback, and Node.js.  </p>

                    <p>The Origin Portal was my first group project. This project has been worked on by several previous groups, so it was pretty challenging at first understanding all of the code that was already in place. But I felt that was great real world experience. The portal was built to allow Employers to connect with Origin graduates looking for jobs. The feature I worked on, was creating a way for employers to post jobs that students could view. So I had to create a form that the Employer could fill out, and then submit that information to the database, so that it could then be used and displayed on another page for the students. <br />The biggest obstacle was getting the modal for the job form to display and close only using React and Redux. Getting the modal's visibility to be kept and updated in 'state' turned out to be very challenging. I was able to complete the task by doing extra research, working with my team, and a good amount of trial and error. </p><br /><p>Technologies used: React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, Loopback, and Bootstrap 4</p>

                    <p>Previous projects in the course all followed the same instructions for each student, but this was the first one where we could choose what we wanted to make. I decided to create a "Random Famous Quote Generator." I utilized two APIs to complete this project. One API was used to get and display a quote by a famous person, and the second API was used to display a photo (if available) of the famous person that said the quote. <br />A difficult part of this project was chaining Axios calls in a single function. The function needed to generate the quote, and then take the name of the person and use it in the second Axios call to generate an image. In prior projects we only used one call at a time, so having one function do multiple Axios calls was a new concept. It took some time to overcome this obstacle, but with some helpful tips from my instructors and research, I was able to do so. After the project was completed I could see and understand what a powerful tool it is to chain Axios calls in that way.</p><br />
